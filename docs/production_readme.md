## Future Features for the App

I plan to constantly make updates to the app to improve its overall functionality. Here are some of the features that I plan to include in later versions of the app:

### Video Support

I plan to extend posts with the ability to post your own videos as well. With all of the camera phones out there today, this is a feature that will be utilized almost as much as photo posts.

###Infinity Scroll and Advanced Post Feed Algorithm
By implementing an infinity scroll feature - I can deliver an endless feed experience to the user just by scrolling. Along with this, an advanced post feed algorithm will enable me to tailor the best posts for the user so that they show up on top of feed.

###Search

With the search function - users will be able to tailor their content. They will be able to search by username, hashtags, multiple hashtags, and general categories. This will enable them to engage with the community of the App in deeper ways.

###Private Chat

People today love to chat with each other. When users find content they enjoy from a particular user - the private chat feature will enable them to get to know each other without everything being public. This will enable users to build lasting relationships and further engage with each other.
